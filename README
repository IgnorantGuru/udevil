PACKAGES

    Find or add packages, forum threads, and other info for your distro:
        https://github.com/IgnorantGuru/spacefm/wiki/Distros

    For other distros:
        See INSTALLER below

    NOTE: See POST INSTALL section below for post-installation steps.


INSTALLER

    A self-extracting installer is available (udevil-x.x.x-installer.sh):
        https://github.com/IgnorantGuru/udevil/tree/pkg
            (To save a file, click on its filename and click 'View Raw')

    The installer requires the build dependencies listed below in BUILD.  If
    any dependencies are missing, examine the error, install missing packages,
    and try again.

    The installer MUST be run in a terminal.  It automatically builds and
    installs.  Run it like this:

        bash udevil-x.x.x-installer.sh

    or to see options:

        bash udevil-x.x.x-installer.sh --help

    To reinstall or upgrade, just run the latest installer again.

    NOTE: See POST INSTALL section below for post-installation steps.


BUILD

    1)  Install required build dependencies (below are Debian package names -
        packages names on your distro may vary but should be similar):

            libglib2.0-0 libglib2.0-dev libudev0 (>=143) libudev-dev
            autotools-dev build-essential fakeroot intltool pkg-config

        Also recommended for network support: cifs-utils curlftpfs sshfs

        Also recommended if using devmon: eject spacefm|zenity

        configure will report anything missing when you run it as shown below.

    2)  Use these commands to download the udevil tarball and build:

        # Download & Extract
        mkdir /tmp/udevil-build && cd /tmp/udevil-build
        wget -O udevil.tar.gz https://github.com/IgnorantGuru/udevil/tarball/master
        tar xzf udevil.tar.gz
        cd IgnorantGuru-udevil-*

        # Build & Install
        ./configure
        make
        sudo make install

        # Remove Temporary Files
        cd / && rm -rf /tmp/udevil-build

    NOTES:

        * If configure reports missing dependencies, install them and run
          configure again before proceeding to make.

        * By default, systemd configuration files for devmon are installed to:
              /etc/conf.d/devmon
              /usr/lib/systemd/system/devmon@.service
          To skip installation of these files, use configure option
          --disable-systemd   In either case, systemd is NOT required.

        * See POST INSTALL section below for post-installation steps.


BUILD NEXT

    The git 'next' branch of udevil is a work in progress which eventually
    becomes the next release version.  To build from this branch, install the
    required build dependencies listed above in BUILD, then:

    # Download & Extract
    mkdir /tmp/udevil-next && cd /tmp/udevil-next
    wget -O udevil-next.tar.gz https://github.com/IgnorantGuru/udevil/tarball/next
    tar xzf udevil-next.tar.gz
    cd IgnorantGuru-udevil-*

    # Build, & Install
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install

    # Remove Temporary Files
    cd / && rm -rf /tmp/udevil-next


CREATE DEB PACKAGE

    To build a deb file of udevil on your Debian-based distro:

    1)  Install build dependencies (see BUILD section above) plus 'debhelper'.

    2)  Use these commands to download and extract the udevil tarball (be sure
        to USE A TMP BUILD PATH THAT DOES NOT CONTAIN SPACES):

        mkdir /tmp/udevil-build && cd /tmp/udevil-build  # no spaces in path
        # Note: you can change "master" to "next" if you want the next branch:
        wget -O udevil.tar.gz https://github.com/IgnorantGuru/udevil/tarball/master
        tar xzf udevil.tar.gz
        cd IgnorantGuru-udevil-*

    3)  Move the distros/debian directory into the source directory:

        mv distros/debian .

    4)  Build package:  (the package files will appear in the parent directory)

        dpkg-buildpackage -b -uc
        cd .. && rm -rf IgnorantGuru-udevil-* udevil.tar.gz

    5)  To install the package you built:

        dpkg -i udevil*.deb


POST INSTALL

    Kernel Polling
    --------------

    You may need to enable kernel polling for device media to be detected by
    udevil.  See ENABLE KERNEL POLLING section below.


    Networks and Files
    ------------------

    By default, /etc/udevil/udevil.conf is set to allow only local fileystems
    and ISO files to be mounted, with mounting of networks disallowed.  To
    allow networks and files to be mounted, in /etc/udevil/udevil.conf set:

        allowed_types = $KNOWN_FILESYSTEMS, file, cifs, nfs, curlftpfs, sshfs, davfs

    You may also need to install curlftpfs or ftpfs (ftp://), cifs or smbfs
    (smb://), sshfs (ssh://), and davfs2 (http://).


    NTFS-3G
    -------

    If local ntfs filesystems aren't mounted writable, you may need to
    configure your system to mount ntfs with ntfs-3g (on some distros this is
    already done).  For example:

        sudo ln -s /sbin/mount.ntfs-3g /sbin/mount.ntfs

        # OR if mount.ntfs-3g is located in /usr/bin:
        sudo ln -s /usr/bin/mount.ntfs-3g /usr/bin/mount.ntfs


    Set SUID
    --------

    After installing udevil, /usr/bin/udevil should have the suid bit already
    set.  If not, set it like this:

        sudo chown root:root /usr/bin/udevil
        sudo chmod u+s,go-s,ugo+x /usr/bin/udevil
        ls -l /usr/bin/udevil
            -rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 226625 May 22 08:13 /usr/bin/udevil

    OR, to restrict execution of udevil to the 'plugdev' group only:

        sudo chown root:plugdev /usr/bin/udevil
        sudo chmod u+s,go-s,o-x /usr/bin/udevil
        ls -l /usr/bin/udevil
            -rwsr-xr-- 1 root plugdev 226625 May 22 08:13 /usr/bin/udevil

    OR, if you don't want to use udevil for mounting, you can unset suid:
        sudo chown root:root /usr/bin/udevil
        sudo chmod ugo-s,ugo+x /usr/bin/udevil
        ls -l /usr/bin/udevil
            -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 226625 May 22 08:13 /usr/bin/udevil

    You can also limit users and groups by editing /etc/udevil/udevil.conf


    systemd Service
    ---------------

    To start devmon as a systemd service:
        systemctl start devmon@<user>


ENABLE KERNEL POLLING

    You may need to enable kernel polling for device media to be detected by
    udevil.  For example, if you insert a CD and udevil's monitor command
    doesn't report a change to the device, or udevil doesn't see a filesystem
    on the device, this is a symptom that kernel polling is not enabled.

    Kernel polling is a newer feature of the Linux kernel and udev, so some
    distros don't yet have it enabled by default.  To use kernel polling,
    your Linux kernel may need to be 2.6.38 or newer, and udev may need to
    be version 173 or newer.

    TO DETERMINE IF KERNEL POLLING IS ENABLED:

        cat /sys/module/block/parameters/events_dfl_poll_msecs
        cat /sys/block/sr0/events_poll_msecs

    If you get 0 or -1 from both of those commands, kernel polling may be
    disabled.

    TO ENABLE KERNEL POLLING PERMANENTLY (survives a reboot), add the
    following command to your /etc/rc.local file (anywhere before the
    'exit' line in that file):

        echo 2000 > /sys/module/block/parameters/events_dfl_poll_msecs

    Any number between 2000 and 5000 (milliseconds) should be reasonable -
    the higher 5000 means poll every 5 seconds, which is less overhead but
    a little slower.

    OR pass this option to the kernel boot command line in grub:

        block.events_dfl_poll_msecs=2000

    OR add a udev rule to enable kernel polling on removable devices:

        echo 'ACTION=="add", ATTR{removable}=="1", \
              ATTR{events_poll_msecs}=="-1", ATTR{events_poll_msecs}="2000"' \
              > /etc/udev/rules.d/61-removable-storage-polling.rules

    A reboot will be required for the above changes to take effect, or...

    TO ENABLE KERNEL POLLING TEMPORARILY AND IMMEDIATELY, enable common
    polling for the block module:

        sudo bash -c 'echo 2000 > /sys/module/block/parameters/events_dfl_poll_msecs'

    OR you can enable polling just for a single device like this (/dev/sr0
    in this example):

        sudo bash -c 'echo 2000 > /sys/block/sr0/events_poll_msecs'

    This change should be immediate - media will be detected.  However, the
    above change will be lost when you reboot.

UNINSTALL

    If you installed from a package, use your package manager to remove udevil.
    Otherwise, extract the tarball and enter the directory containing
    configure:

        # first run configure with your original options if needed:
        ./configure
        sudo make uninstall
        # Note: /etc/udevil/ is not automatically removed
